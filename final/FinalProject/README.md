Welcome to my health app!

In this app, you will be able to create goals for food, water intake, weight, exercise, and any other miscellaneous goal you want. 
You can record your daily values into files, and at the end of the week, you can save your week averages into a file; 
it will consist of the normal values, just all averaged out from your daily files over the course of your week.

I have provided many test files to help you test out the functionality. All functionality is done over the console, as has been
custom over the course of the class.

The week starting 10/22/2023 has one file for Monday that has already been created. It recorded values from the pre-made goals.txt
file. If you want to create your own goals, delete the Dailys/10_23_2023.txt file and create/load the goals from the appropriate 
goal file you created. This program is meant to build off of the goals from the week, so if you do not delete the
Dailys/10_23_2023.txt file, the program will assume that you want to build off the "Other Goals (Exercise or Miscellaneous)" 
that were set for the week.
